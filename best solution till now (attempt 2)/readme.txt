in my previous program i used serpapi which has limit on number of searches as well as it takes too much time
so this time i have used googlesearch library with threadpoolexecuter to solve these issues
still it takes 40 mins for 9900 searches i.e 0.23 s per search
in next update i would research selenium and see if it reduces time further. and also a function could be made which at the end tells how many successful serches and how many unsuccessful due to missing data or 429 too many req error

your running code is in arambh_.py file
ARAMBH_.pyntb is my practice zone
