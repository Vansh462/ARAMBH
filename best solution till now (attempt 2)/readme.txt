in my previous program i used serpapi which has limit on number of searches as well as it takes too much time
so this time i have used googlesearch library with threadpoolexecuter to solve these issues
still it takes 40 mins for 9900 searches i.e 0.23 s per search

your running code is in arambh_.py file
ARAMBH_.pyntb is my practice zone
